## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned
My favourite part about working on this project was using javascript to add fuctionality to my form so that it alerted users if they had an empty fields as they clicked the submit button.

I already familiar with `addEventListener()` and `getElementById()` functions. What was new however was using textContent. I also learnt about innerHTML and innerText. Particulary the secuirty risk of using innerHTML since it can recieve tags, which can be exploited by a treat actor. 


### Continued development
I enjoy manipulating tags using Javascript I will seek to improve in this area.
